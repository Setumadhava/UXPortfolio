            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p>Trailers pulling into Home Depot’s Direct Fulfillment Centeres need to be unloaded efficiently to maintain a steady supply of inventory within the warehouse. The Inbound leaders create an Unload plan to determine how many trailers need
                    to be unloaded and in what priority, how to allocate labor and the capacity inside the building each day to hit their goals. To acheive this, they were using multiple Excel spreadsheets to determine the space and labor availability.

            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p>
                    It was observed that, that the process was not standardized across various DFCs, was time-intensive and laborous since the plan was created manually. The leaders did not have visibility to some critical information to make effective decisions while creating
                    the trailer unload plan. When the trailers were not unloaded efficiently, this affected the inventory available within the building to fulfill customer orders delaying outbound shipment. This also increased the lost sales since the
                    company couldn’t list the products that were not unloaded on the website.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <b>Hypothesis</b><br>We believe that by balancing labor, capacity and trailers available, For DFC Inbound leaders setting the work, We will: Reduce the lead time for inventory availability (time taken from trailer arrival to available
                    for orders), Reduce average age of trailers on the yard, Increase visibility to: Missing information We will know this to be true when we see improvements in OOS (Out of stock), Lost sales, yard age and reductions in aging units over
                    24 hours.<br><br>

                <p> User Journey and mental-model</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sectioncontent">

                <p>We invited one of the users to our office to learn more about the user journey through the process and understand the questions they would seek answers to and the sequence in which they ask these questions as a part of the unload planning
                    process. Initally it was hard to make them articulate since they’re not used to explaining the process to anyone, let alone someone oblivious to the process. To get a better understanding of their mental-model, I did a role play with
                    the user and asked to pretend that she no longer had a laptop and had to talk to a smart digital assistant to do the unload planning process. This worked like magic. Some of the questions that came in her mind while doing the process
                    were:

                    <br><br>■ &nbsp; What’s on the yard?
                    <br><br>■ &nbsp; What’s the labor available for the day?
                    <br><br>■ &nbsp; What regions of the building are the contents of a trailer going to? This method helped us think outside of an interface and get a better understanding of the users’ mental-model. These questions guided us through
                    the sketching process.

                <p>
                    Knowing what questions users ask through the whole planning process acted like a beacon to our whitboarding process. Before sketching, we prioritized the questions to match the business and user goals. Next, we started answering each of the questions
                    the users asked visually. By the end of the activity we had a rough skeleton of what information we should show, the hierarchy of information and layout of the app. In our research we heard that the users do the planning in their office
                    on their laptops and hence we designed the app for a desktop.

                    Once I had a picture of what the app looks like and what information it should provide, I moved to Sketch and digitized the sketches we created. <br><br> I followed the Home Depot’s design system wherever possible and when not available,
                    created my own patterns based to improve the usability of the app. The goal of my design is to ensure the users require zero training to use the app as long as they’re familiar with the unload planning process and goals. I created
                    the prototypes using Sketch and InVision.

                    Once we had a funtional prototype, we tested it with 3 our end-users by making them go through a serious of scenarios and tasks that resembled their unload planning process. This gave the team an opportunity to see if the new solution provided sufficient
                    visibiliy to information the leaders needed to create an unload plan for the day. Apart from a couple of minor discoverability issues, the app performed well and helped the users to create an unload plan succesfully as they expected.
                    We collected the success of tasks and ease of use data from the studies which we later synthesized to identify opportunities for improvement.

            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p>The solution was a desktop app that not only provided the visibility to critical information, but also did much of the heavy lifting of creating an unload plan for the Inboud Leaders. The app was designed to afford a zero-training user
                    experience and when the users tested the app said this exceeded their expectations and would allow them to be more confident with their plans and give them more time to spend with their assocaites. </p>

                <p>The app significantly improved the efficiency of the unload planning process at the Home Depot's fulfillment centers by providing contextual critical information to the leaders making the plan and standardizing the planning process across
                    various buildings. The app added two major value to the company:
                    <br><br>■ &nbsp; Because the app does the heavy-lifting of creating a plan, all a leader has to do is assign the labor available to different receiving functions. This saves a lot of time for the Inbound leaders.
                    <br><br>■ &nbsp; More importantly, because of standardization and automation of the planning process, human errors are greatly reduced and the overall efficiency of the process is increased saving millions of dollars for the company
                    through reduced lost sales. </p>

            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p>The process was anything but smooth. Some of the biggest challenges I faced were:

                    <br><br>■ &nbsp; Despite having 4 weeks of time, the time was just not enough to follow every step of the process. Since many people were involved in the process, working with people’s schedules and unexpected delays increased the
                    drag.

                    <br><br>■ &nbsp; The unload planning process involved a trailer-load of some very complex information (pun intended). Each building leader had their own way of planning, and they all had different goals and priorities. Apart from this,
                    the process is very involved and required visibility a lot of information. Making sense of all the information and keeping the project in scope was a huge challenge.

                    <br><br>■ &nbsp; Collaborating with stakeholders who were not familiar with the design process and selling the value of research to bring the whole team on the same level of understanding while working against a narrow timeline was
                    stressful. This project was one chance for me to prove it to the business leadership that taking time to do research and talking to users was not a waste of time. Working under that pressure gave me a lot of confidence and skills to
                    manage people’s expectations and feelings. Fortunately, by the end of the project the team was able to see the benefits of spending some extra time early in the project for research rather than a lot more later if the wrong product
                    was built.

                <p>Takeaways</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p>This was one of the most complex projects I had to lead without much background and context. However, I was not alone in the project. I constantly involved my product team in all phases of the design process and I regularly pulled in designers
                    from other teams to either facilitate or support me in various design activities. <br><br> This project pushed my abilities more than any other in the past. On the design front, I learned how to facilitate stakehodler meetings, design
                    studios, and improved my interviewing skills to ask better questions during research. On the leadership front, I learned to balance stakeholders’ expectations, assuaging their fears and concerns, helping them and myself navigate through
                    ambiguous situation stemmed from an overwhelming amount of information, and staying focused on the top priorities through out the process. <br><br> Due to the high stakes of the project with low margins for error and the short timeline,
                    I put myself under a lot of have all the answers and being right. However when I faced a deadend, I did not know what to do and got very stressed. After a conversation with a mentor, one of the best lesson I learned and changes I made
                    was to be more comfortable with not knowing answers to every question and knowing it was ok to be wrong. Once I was able to accept this, I began asking better questions and was move forward with much less fear of failing.<br><br> The
                    goal and purpose of a design process is not to end with high-fidelity mock ups rather it is to take the team from a point of low confidence to high confidence with respect to the problem. As a result, we move from a point of high risk
                    to low risk involved in building solution to a complex problem. A high-fidelity mockup, usable or otherwise, is one of the artefacts to validate our assumptions and intuitions and move closer towards the point of confidence. </p>
