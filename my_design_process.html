            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p>My design process has been constantly evolving ever since I started working on my start-up in 2015. When I first started, my design lexicon was limited to designing website screens on photoshop. In my mind, I was designing for a desktop,
                    but I had no idea if what I was designing translated well to a desktop (It didn’t). Over the course of 3 years, I traveled half-way across the world, worked with some incredibly smart people, at some great organizations and as a consequence,
                    my design process has undergone a world of change.</p>

            <div class="sectiontitle">
                <p>Thinking Beyond The Design Tools</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p>
                    As I worked with different teams, on a multitude of problems, I learned that Design is a lot more than just pushing pixels on my favorite design tool. It was a structured process to solve problems in the world and a way to reduce risks while building
                    products. It’s a tool to empathize with people, understand problems and identify the right problem to solve within the constraints of time, technology and budget. I learned that the UX process is not a template for the sake of elongating
                    a portfolio page, rather it’s a Swiss knife to bridge the knowledge gaps between teams, strengthen relationships, improve collaboration, make sense of ambiguity and increase cohesion within diverse teams that are solving complex problems.
                    It took me a while and a lot of mistakes to change how I think and look at design. Once I moved past my honeymoon phase of pretty UI and prototype design, I started to think about the larger context and implications of design. I began
                    asking more Whys. Why does design matter? Why does the design process matter? The more I asked, the more I realized how much I do not know. It was uncomfortable at first, but it was liberating once I made peace with not having answers
                    to everything. <br> <br> Design is not an activity to satisfy our own ego. It’s about creating solutions for people we may never meet and help them achieve their goals with the least amount of friction. Addition
                    of value is not necessarily achieved by adding features or UI elements. If taking away features off of a product can make it easier for a person to finish the task, that’s good design.<br> <br> Why is all of this important you ask?
                    Building software for people we don’t know is an expensive business and the risks involved are high. One of the best ways to reduce the risks is by getting a better understanding of the end-users, the problem to be solved and having
                    a shared understanding of all the information within the product team.

            <div class="sectiontitle">
                <p>The Process</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p>Every design problem and project is unique and the methods I use to address and solve the problems can vary slightly depending on the size of the problem, project timeline etc. Nonetheless, I do follow a structured high-level process of
                    approaching and solving problems. Here is a brief overview of some of the steps I would take and the people I would collaborate with when working on design problems.<br><br><br>
                    <b>Kickoff</b><br> The purpose of a Kick off is to understand the high-level goals and requirements of a project. This meeting includes representation from the business stakeholders, clients, development team and the UX team. In this
                    meeting we identify the problem, our assumptions, goals and risks about the problem at hand. This process is important so that as a team we acknowledge our assumptions — what we know, what we don’t ; the risks involved in the project — what
                    can go wrong and what we can do about it ; the goals of the users, business and the product team. One of the main outputs from this meeting is an ‘Hypothesis’ that works like an anchor and a frame of reference for the rest of the following
                    research process.
                </p>
                <div class="fourembottom"></div>
                <p><b>Research</b><br><br> Building products based on assumptions is like driving on a highway blindfolded. It’s definitely possible to drive but we may not be able to travel too far. The goal of user research is to validate or invalidate
                    our assumptions and hypothesis. Through various research methods like user interviews, contextual inquiry, surveys, role-playing, user-journey mapping etc. I learn more about the users, their behaviors and mental-models, their fears,
                    desires, needs and goals. Once the data is collected, I synthesize the data with the team to identify themes and trends in what we learned from the users.

        <div class="subcontentsection">
            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p><b>Alignment</b><br><br> This is another meeting with the larger team that was involved in the kick-off. The purpose of this meeting is to share the research findings with the team and validate if our assumptions and hypothesis were right.
                    If the research suggestes otherwise, this is an opportunity to course-correct and make adjustments to the problem we’re solving. With the understanding of users and their needs, this meeting helps the team identify the user personas
                    and the problems that are worth solving and those that aren’t. Through various prioritization exercises like stack ranking and 2x2 matrix ranking, the top priorities and the scope of the MVP are identified.

            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p><b>Ideation</b><br> <br>Once I have a clear understanding of the problem and the scope, I move to the ideation process. Through design studios and whiteboarding sessions I work with the team to explore a wide breadth of ideas to solve
                    the identified problems for the respective personas. After we have a large set of ideas, the team is asked to rank the top ideas that are seem functional and feasible and the process is repeated. Through multiple iterations, we start
                    getting closer to a skeleton of the solution. I would then use these sketches to create digital wireframes to get a rough idea of hierarchy of information, general layout and structure of the product. With this, I would also create
                    a low-fidelity prototype.

            <div class="sectioncontent">
                <p><b>Testing and Iteration</b><br><br> The next step of the process is to validate our idea. I’d test the usability of the prototype by putting it in front of users and asking them to complete few tasks they would normally have to do to
                    achieve their goal. Through these usability studies, we would discover if what we believed was the solution is actually working as intended for the users we are trying to build the product for. This is an opportunity to identify what’s
                    working for the users, what’s not and what can be improved. Through iterations the rough edges are polished and the team has a good understanding of what the solution is and what the user needs to achieve their goal.

                <p><b>Collaboration</b><br> <br>The process I explained above is very involved and takes a lot of time. As a designer, I cannot do all of this by myself. I rely upon the team and other people involved in the project for information and support
                    throughout the project. Solving complex problems ranging from healthcare to supply chain, I am usually never the expert in the subject. Through collaboration, I learn more about the process from people who have better understanding
                    in the subject and use my research and design skills to design products that solve problems for the business and the users.

                <p><b>Why I believe in the process</b><br><br> My journey into design hasn’t been easy, especially having to start and survive in a new country and having to live away from my family. But I never regretted making the choice of becoming a
                    designer. When life outside got stressful because of separation, strange visa and immigration policies, I found solace and refuge in design. Solving design problems negated the stress and even helped me solve my personal problems as
                    a designer. I don’t see Design Thinking as a process or tool restricted to solve design problems only. It’s a much broader tool to improve how we think and approach all problems.<br><br> Professionally, I love this Design Thinking
                    because it’s a very efficient process for taking a team from chaos to clarity. I have seen people go from ‘What the hell are we doing??’ at the beginning of a project to “This is amazing! High-fives!” in less than a month of doing
                    Research and Design to build software. And that’s a satisfying feeling to see people feeling more secure and confident about the problems they’re trying to solve. This is a process I have learned through my experience of designing
                    various products and working with various diverse teams and organizations. Design and problem-solving is a vast ocean of knowledge and I am barely scratching the surface. There is still plenty of things out there for me to learn and
                    that’s what I love about being a designer. There’s always something new to learn each day, there are so many amazing people I get to collaborate with and learn from. More than anything, I get the greatest satisfaction when I use my
                    knowledge to design solutions that make someone’s life better.<br><br>
